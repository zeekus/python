Sirbarksalot Bark Detection in Python


1. create a wav audio file

   [ Spectrogram ] 
2. convert the wave file to a Spectrogram using matplot, or something else. 

3. 'Template Matching' - do Template matching for a corolated bark. The spectagram should display the results of a bark signiture. 

4. 'Data Collection' 
     * Read from Autostream every 6 seconds.
       Calculate Spectrogram -> Determine Max Cross Correlation
       Save the File if the Max Cross Correlation > 0.75

     * Collect Many Barks with Few False Alarms
       Limits the Amount o fLabeling Needed...
         .. Barks are Rarely < 0.75
         .. but Biases Training Data

5. Getting started with TensorFlow and Keras
