Issues:
  deposits mess this up.

To do list:
 1. put in cost bases for the lots that are unsold. 
 2. put in a method to manually enter in cost basis.
 3. put in a method to calculate the cost basis on every lot
 4. update the output to include an avg cost basis on the lots in the closing statement.
